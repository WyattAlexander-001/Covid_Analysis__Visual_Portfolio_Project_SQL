# [Project 1: COVID-19 Infection Rate And Death Percentages A Macro To Micro Analysis](https://github.com/WyattAlexander-001/Covid_Analysis__Visual_Portfolio_Project_SQL)
* Created a data analysis and visualization for Covid-19 infection rates and death percentages up to the date of 7/17/2021.
* Data was gathered from "Our World in Data" link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
* Used SQL for analyzing data regarding infection rate and death percentages based on continent, and country. Table were created using Excel. Excel tables were then imported into Tableau for visualization.

## Overview 

Purpose of project was to analyze most recent data on COVID. Tables were prepared using SQL and visualized with Tableau

## [Results](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wyatt1368/viz/COVIDDeathAnalysisGlobalNumbersDashboard/Dashboard1)

Used [SQL Queries](https://github.com/WyattAlexander-001/Covid_Analysis__Visual_Portfolio_Project_SQL/blob/main/COVID_19_Portfolio_Project_7-17-2021/Covid-SQL.sql) to first analyze the global numbers of people infected and death percentage from COVID-19. 

As of 7/17/2021 over 4 million people died of COVID-19 out of the over 189 million people reported as infected. The death percentage is 2.15%, which means that on a global scale, for every 100 people infected with COVID-19, 2 people die.

Looking at a deeper level; by continents, it is revealed that Europe currently has the highest death toll with over 1 million dead, with other continents close behind. South America is over one million, and North America at over 900,000. Asiaâ€™s numbers are perhaps a bit misleading as the sample data had no reported cases in China from the start of the outbreak.

Looking another level lower; by country, I used a Tableau map to visualize the severity of population(s) infected. The darker red areas shows countries with a higher infected population, lighter areas show countries having lower infected population.

Lastly, I created a forecast to see where infection rates may be, 6 months into the future. Looking at the most infected countries, United States is forecasted to have a 15.14% infected populace by March of 2022 and the United Kingdom at 10.55%

Putting everything in one view.

## Improvements

Would like to understand why, "Our World in Data," is missing data from China, new information results may have alter results.
